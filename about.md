Aviv is a curious person. He loves adventure and loves the time he spends with 
his amazing partner Jenny(See her site <a href="https://jennurate.com/#/">here</a> 
she's amazing!)

My time in the world has spanned three continents and many different subjects and
joys. 

Currently I am a Software Engineer at Google but I have also been a Simulation 
Engineer at SpaceX, a researcher at NASA Ames and Stanford, as well as a student
at UC Santa Barbara.

My current interests are in Auction Theory, Asteroid Mining and Prospecting, 
Causal Inference, Generative Machine Learning, Paragliding, Science Fiction 
Literature, and Horology.
